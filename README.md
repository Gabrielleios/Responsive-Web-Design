# Responsive-Web-Design




<b> Responsive-web-responsive </b> is a compilation of mini projects in which I was able to learn about HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.




First, I built a <b> CAT PHOTO APP </b> to learn the basics of HTML and CSS.




Resume about the project:
The cat photo app website is an HTML-only website designed for cat owners
who can answer questionnaires about their cat's habits, add photos and share
their passion for felines with other passionate pet owners.




Second, I built a <b> Menu page for a Cafe </b>
with this project I learned that CSS tells the browser how to display the web page.
I was able to use CSS to define the color, font, size and other aspects of HTML elements.
